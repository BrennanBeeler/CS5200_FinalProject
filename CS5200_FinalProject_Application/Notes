Changes From Proposal:
    Completed:
        1) Added genotype table
        2) Replaced origin cage for mouse with two recursive foreign keys
    To be Changed:
        1) How to get new users to be added to database?

Questions:
1) How to handle user vs admin
    -Could try and have separate SQL users for each - seems hard/like it will be a problem
    -Could have the login info and access be purely managed by application and all users go through same login to server
2) How to control number of cages per rack
