Changes From Proposal:
    Completed:
        1) Added genotype table
        2) Replaced origin cage for mouse with two recursive foreign keys
        3) How to get new users to be added to database?


TODO: Finished

    a rack- if inactive-> doesn't count

- deal with data truncation at sql code 22001
- Change all if statements to be transactions
- sql catch for duplicate primary key
- REMOVE ALL SQL EXCEPTIONS- must be english
