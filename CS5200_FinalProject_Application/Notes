Answered Questions:

Questions:
1)

TODO: Finished
- change add address so it allows same address if entered to reference same entry
- Create abstract class for UserMenu and AdminMenu - create statements etc. where applicable
- Add user view of facility access- but just their own
- turn new_address into transaction


TODO: TODO
- Remove filled slots from rack and instead use a trigger to determine if okay to add cage to
a rack- if inactive-> doesn't count
- Show possible values before insertion
- Make sure that each call to stored procedure is protected with catch that is appropriate
- keep males and females separate
- add descriptions of data order
- go through all stored procedures and make sure to check comments
- test cage number triggers
- test sex triggers
- remove checks to see return type of execute etc.
- test everything
- look to make transactions- delete_address etc.


TODO: MAYBE
- Increase facility name length allowed
- cover all normal errors with customized text




Thinking:
-Adding is easy - just input data when asked for it (both user and admin)
-Removing should be restrictive and only allow deletion of one at a time, since data should only
    be removed from database if there was some kind of entry error/massive change in real world
-Update should allow more broad scope changes
    + User should only be able to make small single serving updates...


-View
    -To view mouse - mouse data + cage + rack + room + facility + manager
        + Filter by various stuff - sex, manager, facility, room, rack, cage, genotype
